                        This bootcamp project utilized Terraform to provision AWS resources and Go code to create a Terraform custom provider. The journal in the GitHub repository contains a detailed description of the weekly progress.

                       Terraform custom provider: Provider written in Go code and a Sinatra mock server
                       'Terrahouse' resources: These resources are created at 'Terratowns cloud' using the custom provider.
                       AWS resources: The AWS module contains two nested modules, one for creating a CloudFront distribution and invalidation and another for creating an S3 bucket.
